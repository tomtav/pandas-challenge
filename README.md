## Background

Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, I've finally scratched my idealistic itch and joined the education sector. As Chief Data Scientist for the fictitious city's school district, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

I have been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My responsibility was to perform the following analysis:

* Analyze the district-wide standardized test results. 

* Aggregate the data and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Analysis
1. In reviewing the school analysis by type and size, I found that the top five performing schools were all Charter schools and the bottom five performing school were all District schools.

2. I also observed that small Charter schools have the highest Math (33.8% higher), Reading (17.8% higher), and Overall passing rates (25.3% higher) than larger district schools. This represents an inverse correlation between school size and student performance.

3. In reviewing average math and reading scores by grades, there is no large increase in scores from all schools as students move up grade levels. The average scores tend to be very similar across grade levels.

3. A limitation I observed with the values provided for school budgets is the lack of data regarding how a school distributed the funds. In order to determine if spending correlates with passing rate I need more information. From my experience, low performing schools are provided more funding but audits have found that not all schools increase their per student budget in all circumstances.
